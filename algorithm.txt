ALGORITHM
STEP: IMPORT ALL THE LIBRARIES THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR BUILDING THE MODELS AND VISUALISING THE DATA 
STEP 1 : ACCEPT THE DATAFRAME FORM THE USER DIRECTORY AND DISPLAY TOP 5 ROWS OF DATAFRAME
STEP 2: CONVERT ALL THE DATA INTO NUMERIC FORMAT AND DISPLAY TOP 5 ROWS OF THE UPDATED DATAFRAME 
STEP 3: CHECK FOR  MISSING VALUES IF FOUND THEN REPLACE THAT PLACE WITH MEAN VALUE
STEP 4: BUILD THE CORRELATION MATRIX AND DISPLAY IT NORMALLY AND BY USING HEATMAP ALSO
STEP 5: SHOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FEATURES USING SCATTER PLOTS
STEP 6: SPLIT THE DATASET INTO TRAINING AND TESTING DATASETS
STEP 7: IMPLEMENT THE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL WITH THE TRAINING AND TESTING DATASETS                           }REPEAT THE SAME STEPS
STEP 8: DISPLAY THE COEFFICENT AND INTERCEPTS OF THE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL 				       }BY CHANGING THE ALGORITHM NAMES
STEP 9:EVALUATE THE PERFOMANCE OF THE MODEL BY FINDING THE MEAN_ABSOLUTE_ERROR OF THE MODEL AND DISPLAY IT     }
STEP 10:BUILD A PLOT BY USING PREDICTION AND REAL VALUES OF LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL                            }
STEP 11:THEN DRAW A PERFECT PREDICTION LINE AND DISPLAY IT                                                     }
